		<dt>Protocol</dt>
		<dd>A standardized set of rules for formatting and processing data</dd>
		<dt>Packet</dt>
		<dd>A small segment of a larger message</dd>
		<dt>Header</dt>
		<dd>Headers are informational data containing where a packet is from, where it's going to, and other metadata</dd>
		<dt>Payload</dt>
		<dd>The data that is transmitted over a network</dd>
		<dt>Router</dt>
		<dd>A router directs packets to their correct destination, and are made for directing packets</dd>
		<dt>Routing Table</dt>
		<dd>Data that is stored in a router that is like a map of network destinations, this helps the router chose the best route to take a packet through</dd>

	<p>Problems we encountered in the class simulation</p>
	<ol>
		<li>The first problem we had was randomly sending packets to whoever we were connected with, not knowing where to send anything, and not knowing the IP's of anybody.</li>
		<li>The second problem we encountered was only being able to ask the IP addresses of those who we had connections with, not being able to communicate with the other side of the room.</li>
	</ol>
	<p> To fix these problems we came up with a couple of things. Firstly we asked the IP's of those near us to see if any of them had the correct destination, if they did not we would ask them what connections they had and so on, slowly creating a map of the system. This ensured we wouldn't send packets the wrong way, even if we didn't know everybodys IP's we would know what direction would most likely have the destination.</p>
