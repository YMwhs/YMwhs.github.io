	<h1>Welcome to my second page</h1>
	<p>Here are some things that I like!</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I like to walk because it's relaxing.</li>
		<li>I also like to spend time with my family, and extended family, because I have a lot of cousins.</li>
		<li>Lastly, I like to play videogames because they're fun.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Here is one of my favorite poems</p>
	<hr>
	<blockquote>
	<pre> You have brains in your head.
	You have feet in your shoes.
	You can steer yourself in any direction you choose.
	You’re on your own.
	And you know what you know.
	You are the guy who’ll decide where to go.</pre>
	<p><em>- Dr. Suess</em></p>
	<blockquote>
	<hr>
	<p>A regular morning in my life during a school day looks like:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><code>I wake up at 5:50am.</code></li>
		<li>I take a shower from 6:00-6:25.</li>
		<li>I get ready from 6:25-6:35.</li>
		<li>I eat breakfast with what remaining time I have left, and check school work.</li>
		<li>Then I walk to my bus stop, and get to school.</li>
	</ol>
	<hr>
	<p>Some of my favortie keyboard shortcuts are <kbd>Command + C</kbd>, <kbd>Command + V</kbd>, and <kbd>Command + X</kbd>.</p>
	<p>I like those shortcuts because they provide easy movement, and less <samp>Mistakes</samp> when moving pieces of information.
