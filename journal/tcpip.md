# The TCP/IP Model

The TCP/IP Model has four layers

## Application

Includes **protocols**:

- SSH
- WWW
- Email
- SMS
- VOIP

Application is the first layer, in which applications interact with the network using protocols to preform tasks like web browsing, emailing, and transferring files.

## Transport

Includes things like:

- Packets
- TCP
- UDP

The transport layer is second, and  is responsible for makign sure data is sent reliably and in correct order between devices. It uses different protocols for different situations to transport these packets, for example TCP takes longer to move things but makes sure the packets are sent right, while UDP prioritizes time over quality for things like videos or phone calls, to make sure things are sent in real time.

## Internet

Includes:

- IP

The internet layer is third, responsible for addressing and routing packets across the network, using IP as a guide. It addresses and sends off packets to the correct address that it's supposed to go to.

## Link

Includes:

- Ethernet
- Wi-Fi
- LTE
- Bluetooth

The link layer is last, and is responsible for handling the physical connection to the network transmitting raw data over a medium. This speeds up the link between a network.
